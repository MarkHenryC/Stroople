Stroople
A Corona project created in 2010

Stroople is an impulse-control game based on the Stroop Test.

This is the complete product, as released in the iTunes store. It's (hopefully) for educational purposes for new Corona users, or can form the base of a similar simple animated puzzle game.

Some of the functionality in the code can probably be replaced by using newer APIs provided by later versions of Corona.

Please don't re-publish this as your own game. If you want to use it as the base for something more interesting, go ahead. 

Permission is granted by Mark H Carolan to re-use the code for commercial purposes or otherwise, but be sure to replace all the graphics and audio with your own. Use of this code is totally at your own risk; no responsibility taken if it causes you any grief whatsoever, drinks your beer, crashes your stockmarket portfolio or repaints your car in a really awful colour.

NOTE: a user has reported a problem caused by fonts not being retrieved using the API call native.getFontNames(). This subsequently caused a crash, passing a nil font to newText().
